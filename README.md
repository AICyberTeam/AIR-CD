# AIR-CD
We build a challenging cloud detection dataset called AIR-CD, with higher spatial resolution and more representative landcover types. The dataset will be open to the community to provide support for research in the field of cloud detection.

To help readers download the AIR-CD dataset later, we have uploaded part of the dataset, including 7 original remote sensing images and corresponding labels. To facilitate the observation, we visualize the label, using white pixels to represent the cloud and black pixels to represent the background. The complete data set and detailed introduction will be released after the corresponding article is published.
